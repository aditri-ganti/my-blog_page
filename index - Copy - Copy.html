				<p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

			<p class="text-muted text-left">I was lucky enough to spend a week at the Taj hotel which is blessed with several restaurants, several of which I ate at during my stay. The best overall experience I had was at Souk where the food was outstanding (try in particular the mezze selection option which gives diners a chance to pick old favourite or new dishes as they choose) and the service was both efficient and friendly. I am an unreconstructed carnivore but the vegetarian selections here were out of this world, and I would consider converting if all restaurants had as tasty vegetarian options as does Souk.

			<p>Overwhelming. It best describes the final chapter that culminates Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 21 iconic films into one. And that also describes the experience of watching your favourite superheroes come together for a singular goal, for one last time. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo ensure that the humongous build-up and the avalanche of expectations do not get the better of them. They deliver a largely wholesome product that is full of moments laced with action, emotion, comedy and drama. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take you along, even if you haven’t been following the franchise. They do an incredible job with the screenplay to balance emotions with visual spectacle. So if you’re not a fan yet, chances are, you might become one after watching this instalment.</p>

			<p>As a big fan of this film since childhood, I know that the 1994 version of this visually fantastic movie will never be beaten. Thus, the remake of this film did not reach that goal. However, it did bring some new perspectives for millions of eyes around the world. Jon Favreau, director of many films, including 2016's the Jungle Book, did an excellent job with this CGI remake of the Lion King.
				I am proud to be one of several theater witnesses on opening day to watch this wonderfully made film. Although -- admittedly -- the animals don't have a flexible amount of facial expressions, the story, the music, the scenery, to me, is what was most important. I think Jon and the whole cast and crew did a wonderful job recreating a masterpiece, trying not to top it, but trying to expand it a little for the new generation of high film making technology. I did cry a few times, I laughed several times, but my mouth was in awe nearly the entire way through. One of the things that excited me for this movie was the major fact that the legendary James Earl Jones, the original Mufasa himself, decided to come back to play everyone's favorite king of the Pridelands. At age 88, he sounds as though he hardly aged! What a blessing.
				Everyone else did a splendid job with their parts, creating emotions through their body language if not through their faces. The crew did beautifully with the realistic visual designs for both the scenes and the characters. The music had me moving so much as it was a near replica of the original soundtrack from 1994 -- only, it was more epic!
				Thank you again, Jon, for collaborating with Disney and several other talented people, to help make this movie beautiful, moving, and intense, once again. I look forward to buying this on DVD once it releases!</p>

			<p>I like the song. "The snow glows white on the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I'm the queen The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried Don't let them in, don't let them see Be the good girl you always have to be Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know Well, now they know Let it go, let it go Can't hold it back anymore Let it go, let it go Turn away and slam the door I don't care what they're going to say Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do To test the limits and break through No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free Let it go, let it go I am one with the wind and sky Let it go, let it go You'll never see me cry Here I stand and here I stay Let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast I'm never going back, the past is in the past Let it go, let it go When I'll rise like the break of dawn Let it go, let it go That perfect girl is gone Here I stand in the light of day Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway". love it so much

			<p>Prince of Persia was an immensely enjoyable movie. Below I list the positives and few negatives of the movie before summarising. The visuals in this movie are stunning. Everything from the cinematography of the desert landscapes to the city of Alamut and the beautiful sets are a real treat to look at.</p>

						This title and others form part of a series of books that takes an off-beat look at nature and natural sciences through a fun combination of Seussian rhymes and zany illustrations. Aimed at early readers - from four to seven year olds - the books are designed to bridge the gap between concept books written for preschoolers and more formal non fiction titles that require fluent reading skills. By presenting the facts in a lively and rhythmic manner, they provide the critical foundation upon which complex facts and ideas can eventually be built.
